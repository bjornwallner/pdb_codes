Installation notes

Environmental variable PROQDIR needs to be set to the location where
it is installed i.e:
export PROQDIR=/home/ae/bjorn/bin/ProQCA/


ProQCA uses secondary structure prediction in the current version the
prediction should be in the header of the pdb file denoted by "REMARK
SS" see example in bar.pdb:

kantarell$ head bar.pdb
REMARK SS CCCCCCCCCCCCCCHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHCCCCCHHHHHHHHHHCCCHHHHHHHCCCCCCCCHHHHHHHHHHCCCCHHHHHHHCCCCCCCCCCCEEECCCCEEEEEECCCCCEEEECCCCCCCCCCEEEECCCCCCCCCHHHHHCCCCCCCCCCCCCEEEEEECHHHHHHHHHCCCCCCEECCCCCCCHHHHHHHHHHCCEEEEEEECCCHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHCCCEEEEEECCCCCCHHHHHHHCCHHHHHHHHHCCCHHHHHHHHHHHCCCCCCCHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHCCCCHHHHHHHHHHHHHCCCCCHHHHCCCCCC
REMARK SCORE 8.5
MODEL 3

REMARK correct structure: Fri Feb  8 15:16:39 2002./BW

SEQRES   4    338  VAL ALA THR SER ALA ARG GLN TYR LEU GLU LYS ARG GLY 

The length of ss prediction should correspond to the number of
residues in the pdb file.


Running

If you have set the PROQDIR and have the REMARK SS in the pdb files
the only thing you have to give to ProQCA is a list of all pdb files,
i.e: 
kantarell$ head list
bar.pdb
bar.pdb
bar.pdb
bar.pdb

kantarell$ ./ProQCA list
bar.pdb                          0.6772    0.0401
bar.pdb                          0.6772    0.0401
bar.pdb                          0.6772    0.0401
bar.pdb                          0.6772    0.0401

The second column is the predicted -log of LGscore, the third column
is the predicted MaxSub score.

Hope everything work, do not hesitate to email me if something does
not work or look strange.
