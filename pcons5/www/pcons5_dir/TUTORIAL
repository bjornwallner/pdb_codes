How to set up your local meta-server?

1) be sure that Pcons5 runs with the supplied example files described
in the README file.


2) Pcons5 consists of three modules, a consensus, a structure evaluation
and a fold recognition score module.

By default the fold recognition score module uses the cutoffs in the
file "cutoff.init" to estimate the reliability of a score from a
certain method.

Example:
kantarell$ head cutoff.init 
genthreader        0.76400    0.59700    0.58200    0.51800
test              39.55000   19.12000   11.75000    7.34000
fmiZ             100.92000   43.36000   20.16000    6.03000
supfampp         183.37390   58.13556   63.25155    0.13926

Description:
1st column - method name
2nd column - 90\% of the models with a score above this value are "very good" 
3rd column - 50\% of the models with a score above this value are "very good" 
4th column - 90\% of the models with a score above this value are "good"
5th column - 50\% of the models with a score above this value are "good"

We used the LGscore as our quality measure, a score above 3 were "very
good" and 1.5 were "good".

3) If the methods you are using is NOT already in the "cutoff.init"
file you need to define the four cutoffs described above. This can be
done using LGscore as we did (on some set of models produce by the
method) or using some other quality measure like MaxSub with for
instance 0.5 for "good" and 0.8 for "very good" or you can set your
own cutoffs based on your own preferences. Be sure that the method
name is the same as the name in the "REMARK METHOD" field in the PDB
files.

4) If Pcons5 is run on a method that does not exist in the
"cutoff.init" file the fold recognition score evalution will be
skipped and the final score will only be based on the consensus and
structural evaluation analysis.
