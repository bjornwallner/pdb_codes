Citation
--------

Please cite the following paper when using ProQres:

Identification of correct regions in protein models using structural,
alignment and consensus information. Björn Wallner and Arne Elofsson
(2005). Protein Sci., 15(4):900-913


Description
-----------

The program predicts a local quality measure between 0 and 1 for each
residue in a protein (0 is bad and 1 is good). 

The following programs needs to be installed:
naccess
stride
psipred


Installation
------------
1) Set the environment variable PROQRESDIR to the location where the neural network weights are:
In bash:
bash$ export PROQRESDIR=/afs/pdc.kth.se/home/b/bjornw/source/c/pdb/ProQres/ProQres1.0/weights

2) Set the maximum stack size to unlimited
In bash:
bash$ ulimit -s unlimited



Usage
------

ProQres  args
                 -base [basename (*.ss2,*.rsa,*.stride,*.pdb)]
                 -pdb  [pdb file]
                 -surf [surface file]
                 -stride  [stride file]
                 -psipred [psipred file]
 

-pdb is the model to be evaluated      (apa.pdb)
-surf is the rsa file from naccess     (apa.rsa)
-stride is the output from stride      (apa.stride)
-psipred is the ss2 file from psipred  (apa.ss2)
-base if all files are located at the same place with *.ss2,*.rsa,*.stride,*.pdb 
extensions a simple -base apa work as well.


Example
------

These are eqvivalent:
bash$ ./ProQres -base apa
bash$ ./ProQres -pdb apa.pdb -surf apa.rsa -stride apa.stride -psipred apa.ss2
